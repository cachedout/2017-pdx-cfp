## Event-Driven Infrastructure


## Abstract 

As we move firmly into the era of highly-distributed systems with very
large numbers of systems to manage, new questions about how to manage the
full lifecycle of an application stack healthy and performant. In order to
do so, automation systems need to themselves adapt so that they can be
reactive to changes in the system in near real-time. 

In this talk, we'll discuss the origins of an event-driven infrastructure
approach, discuss the sorts of problems that next-generation event-driven
tooling will need to solve and we'll take an overview into the fundamental
concepts that all event-driven tooling should adopt. Finally, we'll cover
what it takes to build a proof-of-concept for a basic event-driven
management system and then cover various off-the-shelf solutions.
